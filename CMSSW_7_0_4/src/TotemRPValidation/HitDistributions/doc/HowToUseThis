1) Prepare a simulation ROOT file. The simulation must be performed up to RPFittedTrackCollection production. You can use config files 
	Config/SimulateElastic_*.cfg in CVS offline/user/jan
to simulate elastic events.

2) Update test/hitsBeta90.cfg: select input and output file and list of RP for which you want to produce hit distributions.
You should also include geometry configuration used to generate input file.

3) cmsRun test/hitsBeta90.cfg
