This project is intended to provide the utility to merge CMS and Totem ntuples. 

In principle there are two main applications of the software:
 - finding the orbit offset between CMS and Totem events
 - merging events from CMS and Totem ntuples
 
There are three directories:
 - CMSdataFormat - stores cms ntuple classes defintions
 - TOTEMdataFormat - store totem ntuple classes definitions
 - Merge - contains two programs: findOrbitOffset/merge12 and mergeNtuples/combine
 I strongly recommend to use findOrbitOffset and mergeNtuples. These programs
 are more efficient but need some testing. merge12 and combine are stored in the repository just
 in case of any problems.


Bellow I give instructions how to compile and run the software:
To compile the software:
 * Source root and gcc
  - if you want to use that software with job splitter please do:
  source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.4.3/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/setup.sh
  source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.26.00a/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
 * Adjust the paths in Merge/Makefile 
  - variables: TotemSrc, CMSSrc, TotemLibrary, CMSLibrary
  - I use absolute paths
  - you can either use absolute paths or try to play with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * Compile software
  - go to Merge/ directory
  - make
  - this command will compile CMS data formats, Totem data formats and merging/searching for offset software
  - in case of any problems try once more (make clean and then make)
  
To find orbit offfset:
 * compile the software
 * go to Merge/ directory
 * ./findOrbitOffset (./merge12) totemNtuplePath cmsNtuplePath outputNtuple
 * you can find example totem and cms ntuples on CASTOR:
  - totem: /castor/cern.ch/totem/offline/CMSTOTEM/TotemNtuples/HighBeta/8372.0-99_ntuple.root
  - cms: /castor/cern.ch/totem/offline/CMSTOTEM/CMSNtuples/HighBeta/UABaseTree_CMS-TOTEM_LP_MinBias1_Run2012C-PromptReco-v1-HighBetaJuly2012-Run198901_uaBaseTree-v1_mergedTTree.root
 * you can find some comments in the code (merge12.cc) which should help you to understand what's going on
 * as far as we tested orbit offset was always 0
 
To merge ntuples:
 * find the orbit offset (up to now it was always 0)
 * set the orbit difference in mergeNtuples (main function mergeNtuples(0, totem, cms, outputFileName) -> mergeNtuples(foundOrbitDifference, totem, cms, outputFileName))
 * compile the software
 * go to Merge/ directory
 * ./mergeNtuples (./combine) totemNtuplePath cmsNtuplePath outputNtuple
